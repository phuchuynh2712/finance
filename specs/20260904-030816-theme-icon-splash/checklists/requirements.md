# Specification Quality Checklist: Rebrand Theme, App Icon & Icon Library

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-09-04
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All items pass. The design handoff package (`reference/theme-tokens.json`, `reference/icons-used.json`, `reference/README.md`, `reference/app-icon/`) provided complete palette, typography, icon, and asset detail, so no [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers were needed.
- This spec explicitly supersedes `specs/20260724-app-icon-theme/` — the previous green/network-icon brand and green/gold-only palette are being fully replaced, and superseded assets must be removed per FR-015.
- 2026-09-04 clarification: manual light/dark theme toggle deferred to a future Profile/Settings feature; this spec ships system-driven theme switching only (see FR-009 and Clarifications section).
